MATLAB Implementations of 2D Multilateration Algorithms

This repository contains software that use 2D multilateration algorithms to determine the location of a sound source. This is part of a larger project I am currently on to use piezoelectric discs to turn any flat surface into a touch enabled surface using cheap and modular hardware. If you are intrested in this idea/project, reach out to me.
